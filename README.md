# Finger-BCI-Decoding

This is a repository of the scripts used for the study: “EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface Enables Real-time Robotic Hand Control at Individual Finger Level”.

Y. Ding, C. Udompanyawit, Y. Zhang, and B. He: “EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface Enables Real-time Robotic Hand Control at Individual Finger Level,” Nature Communications, 2025.

The scripts include the online processing and decoding as well as offline deep learning model training. EEGNet is used in this study and the tensorflow implementation of EEGNet is downloaded from the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) EEGModels project [1].
